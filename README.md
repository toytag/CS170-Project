# CS 170 Project Spring 2020

Take a look at the project spec before you get started!

## Requirements:

Python 3.6+ with packages:

- numpy
- networkx
- matplotlib

If you have `pip3`, just run
```
pip3 install numpy networkx matplotlib
```

## Files:
- `parse.py`: Functions to read/write inputs and outputs
- `solver.py`: Our code to solve inputs
- `utils.py`: Contains functions to compute cost and validate NetworkX graphs
- `max_st.py`: Run all inputs altogether using multi-thread methods
- `prepare_submission.py`: Code for submission

## Instruction of Usage:
  - When trying to solve for a single input file, run:
  ```
  python3 solver.py [input_file_name]
  ```
  - When trying to solve for all inputs at once, run:
  ```
  python3 max_st.py
  ```
  
  - Note: you have to put all input files in the folder `inputs/`, and create a folder `outputs/` before running `max_st.py`.
  - Note: Remember to remove all other irrelevant files in the `inputs/` folder (such as `.DS_Store` automatically generated by macOS file system) in case that the parser throw an error.
